## Hi, I'm Glenvio 👋

I’m a cybersecurity student with a strong interest in **web exploitation**  
and an **attacker mindset balanced with defensive thinking**.

This GitHub is my **learning journal and technical workspace** — a place where I:
- Document my learning process
- Store CTF write-ups (competition & practice)
- Build and experiment with security lab simulations
- Grow step by step through hands-on projects

### Focus Areas
- Web exploitation (SQLi, LFI/RFI, command injection, logic flaws)
- Linux-based services and web applications
- Attack & Defense mindset: understanding both exploitation and mitigation
- Python for automation and security-related scripting

### What you’ll find here
- 📂 **CTF write-ups** — focused on methodology and lessons learned  
- 🧪 **Lab simulations** — controlled environments for testing attacks & defenses  
- 🛠️ **Small projects & scripts** — built while learning and experimenting  

This repository reflects my **progress over time**, not just finished results.
Everything here is part of a continuous learning journey.

Learning. Breaking. Fixing. Improving.
