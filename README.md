## Hi, I'm Glenvio

I'm a vocational high school student at **SMK Telkom Purwokerto**, majoring in Computer Network and Telecommunications Engineering. I have a strong interest in cybersecurity, particularly in web exploitation, with an attacker mindset balanced by defensive thinking.

This GitHub serves as my learning journal and technical workspace — a place where I:

- Document my learning process
- Store CTF write-ups from competitions and practice
- Build and experiment with security lab simulations
- Grow step by step through hands-on projects

---

## Current Focus

I'm currently diving deep into three core areas:

**Cryptography**  
Classical ciphers, RSA vulnerabilities, steganography, and cryptanalysis techniques

**Reverse Engineering**  
Binary analysis, bytecode reversing, decompilation, and understanding program flow

**Web Exploitation**  
SQL Injection, LFI/RFI, command injection, SSRF, authentication bypass, and logic flaws

---

## What You'll Find Here

**CTF Write-ups** — Detailed methodology and lessons learned from picoCTF, HackTheBox, and TryHackMe  
**Lab Simulations** — Controlled environments for testing attacks and defenses  
**Scripts & Tools** — Python automation and security-related utilities built while learning
