## 👨‍💻 About Me

Hi, I'm **Glenvio** — a vocational high school student at **SMK Telkom Purwokerto** studying Computer Network & Telecommunications Engineering (TJKT) with a growing interest in cybersecurity.

I'm working on building a solid foundation in security fundamentals through hands-on practice, CTF competitions, and self-directed learning. While I'm still at the beginning of my journey, I approach cybersecurity with genuine curiosity and consistent effort.

**Current Status:**
- 🎓 Grade 11 student preparing for industry experience
- 🎯 Seeking PKL (internship) opportunities in Yogyakarta's cybersecurity sector
- 📚 Building practical skills through CTF challenges and lab exercises
- 🔧 Learning by doing — one vulnerability, one challenge at a time

**What This GitHub Represents:**

This repository is my learning journal. It's not a portfolio of expert work — it's a record of progress, practice, and persistence. Every commit represents a step forward in understanding how security works.

## 🎯 Current Learning Focus

I'm actively developing skills in these areas:

**Web Application Security (Fundamentals)**
- Learning manual SQL Injection techniques
- Understanding Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) variants
- Practicing IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference) identification
- Exploring authentication and authorization vulnerabilities

**Cryptography (Introductory Level)**
- Classical cipher analysis
- Basic RSA concepts and common weaknesses
- Hash cracking fundamentals with Hashcat
- Steganography basics

**Reverse Engineering (Beginner)**

### 🚀 Learning Philosophy
```
I don't know everything. I'm not trying to.

I'm focused on:
✓ Learning consistently
✓ Building fundamentals properly
✓ Documenting my progress
✓ Getting 1% better every day

The goal isn't to be the best.
The goal is to be better than yesterday.
